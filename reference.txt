## Markdown

Markdown is a markup language and a simple way to add formatting to web texts.
With format we refer to italics, bold, lists, and so on. Markdown was originally
created by John Gruber, with the help of Aaron Swartz, with the purpose of creating
a plain text that is easy to write and easy to read, and that could be converted 
simply and validly to XHTML
